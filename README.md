# Character-recognization
A Character (Handwriting) to Text Software Using Neural Network.
Aim is to Make a Software that can convert different types of handwriting into text using character recognization of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
For this We will use different layers of Neural Network .
Initially it will only support English but later on we will try to implement it for many other local languages.
We will first take a picture of something handwritten in english feed it to the input layer of neural network.
Then the hidden layer will take it from input layer and analyze it i.e it will recognize the alphabets or whole words written.
Then the output layer will give us the output in digital text format.
